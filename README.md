Describes Underdog Fantasy's Betting Scheme and Trends

## Description
The plots below show the trends of how different amount of legs of parlays correspond to the amount of money that could be made depending on the user's hit rate per bet. Each bar on each graph is taken by the average of 1000 trials and each trial runs 1000 parlays of the same type. The hit percentage on the x axis of each graph represents what percentage of straight bets that the bettor hits.

## Trend Analysis
The graphs are drastically right skewed, so much so that if the bettor's hit percentage on straight bets is below 50%, they are shown to go bankrupt nearly 100% of the time over a long period of time. This is expected as if it were really a fair game and the users had an equal chance to make money than they did to lose, then it wouldn't be profitable for the company.

At a 50% hit rate, only the 2 leg parlays returned even a small portion of money back. Anything above this and now this is where we can start to see money being made. For bettors hitting between 50-60% of bets, it appears as though 2 and 3 leg bets are the most profitable as it gives more room for error while still providing a small amount of profit. On the other hand, if a bettor is hitting 60% or more of their bets, they should gear towards 5 leg bets as those provide the greatest return and although many bets will still be lost, the large wins will make up for the small losses.
